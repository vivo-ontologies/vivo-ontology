# The VIVO Ontology

The VIVO Ontology is used to represent scholarship.

## A note about licensing

The VIVO Ontology is in the public domain, and free to use. The VIVO Ontology file includes terms from other ontologies. These ontologies
may have their own licenses and may not be in the public domain. While the VIVO Project has made every effort to ascertain the
licenses of each of the terms it uses, this has not always been possible. Some of these terms may have licenses that prevent
their use in some settings.

## A note about development

The VIVO Ontology and related *VIVO ontologies* are under active development by the [VIVO Ontology Interest Group](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/VIVO/Ontology+Interest+Group) of the [VIVO Project](https://vivo.lyrasis.org).
The group holds regular meetings and is open to all. Please consider participating.

VIVO Ontologies is an open source community. All are welcome to open issues, participate in discussions, and generate pull reqeuests.

You can contribute using the fork, branch and pull model. Helpful descriptions of the process are available [on the VIVO wiki](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/VIVO/Contributing+code+with+a+fork%2C+branches%2C+and+pull+requests).
